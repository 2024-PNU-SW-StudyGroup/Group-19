Technologies for Data scientists
    1. Programming technology
    2. mathmatics and statistics
    3. Domain knowledge (knowledge about business problem)

Data analyst's work process
    In broad sense, it includes data collecting, data processing and modeling.
    In a narrow sense, it includes descriptive statistics(기술 통계), EDA(exploratory data analysis, 탐색적 데이터 분석)
    and hypothesis testing(가설 검정)

Data mining and machinelearning
Data mining is a process which is extract pattern or knowledge from data and
machine learning is a technology which is making a software that learn rules automatically from data
-> They look similar but there are some differences between them.
    1. Patterns from datamining are used by human. However patterns from machinelearning are used by computer
    2. Comparatively, we can know the datamining algorithm more apparently than machinelearning

Python package we will use.
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. scipy
5. scikit-learn

What is encoding, UTF-8, EUC-KR?
-> encoding means texts transform in binary which computer can understand.
and UTF-8 and EUC-KR are one of the encoding methods

What is pandas?
-> pandas is a python package which store CSV files into dataframe form
Dataframe is two-dimensional array(2차원 배열) which consist of row(행, 가로줄) and column(열, 가로줄).
we can't use different data type in same row.

What is Series?
-> We can define series as a row of dataframe easily.
